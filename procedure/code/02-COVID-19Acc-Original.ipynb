    "## Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "The reproduction results closely match the orginal results, with a Spearman's *Rho* close to 1 (perfect correlation).\n",
    "**Here, differentiate correlation results for a buffered network vs not buffered network.**\n",
    "We can reject the NULL hypothesis of no correlation between the reproduction results and the original results.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we also note several challenges and uncertainties.\n",
    "First, the large file sizes and processing times for the full state of Illinois caused challenges in using GitHub as the repository and scaling the reproduction efforts.\n",
    "This challenge was addressed by the original research team's decision to limit the reproduction study materials to the city of Chicago.\n",
    "Unfortunately, that decision led to unanticpated boundary effects and numerous bugs in the code. We have attempted to resolve all of those issues with this reproduction.\n",
    "Second, the original results were not provided with sufficient metadata to know which permutation of the data and code were used to generate them.\n",
    "They cannot be identically reproduced with the provided Chicago road network, they do not appear to identically match the maps in the published paper, and we have failed to identically them with a new buffered road network from OpenStreetMap.\n",
    "The new buffered network produces more similar results, with no discernable difference whether the at risk population (over the age of 50) or the COVID patients (cases) population has been used.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reproduction effort has identified some additional sources of error and uncertainty which may be addressed with future work.\n",
    "*First*, there will always be boundary effects with the E2SFCA method, which can only be alleviated by including service points to a distance equal to the maximum travel time away from the study extent, and network data and population data to a distance equal to twice the maximum travel time away from the study extent.\n",
    "*Second*, there is substaintial missing data in OpenStreetMap speed limits, and the original study has applied speed limits of 35mph to all unknown road segments, even though many are highways and the non-highway urban speed limit in Illinois is 30mph.\n",
    "*Third*, the study has reaggregated population data to hospital catchments using centroid points, and has re-aggregated catchment areas to the final hexagonal grid if there is 50% or more overlap.\n",
    "Both reaggregations would be more accurate and less sensitive to the modifiable areal unit problem if they used area-weighted reaggregation.\n",
    "Finally, there are numerous opportunities to increase the computational efficiency of the code, e.g. by i) reducing redundancies between different versions of the model by processing and storing data before customizing model parameters, ii) reducing by a third the number of network analysis operations, and iii) using GeoPandas spatial indexing to optimize nearest neighbor searching and overlay analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is difficult to continue reproducing a study like this in updated computational environments because packages like OSMnx have undergone numerous updates, rely on numerous dependencies, and draw data from a dynamic source: OpenStreetMap.\n",
    "This reproduction study was feasible because the authors developed the research in an open science geospatial cyberinfrastructure community, CyberGISX.\n",
    "They published the majority of code required to execute the study, and made access to the computational infrastructure available to other researchers.\n",
    "This enabled the current research team to reproduce the study without building our own cyberinfrastructure, and with minimal or no prior knowledge using Jupyter notebooks or Python.\n",
    "However, becuase the research was conducted on a shared server, there is no readily available documentation for re-creating a suitable computational environment on a local machine, e.g. through a Conda yaml file.\n"
